# Satsuma

A local file- and streaming-music player for Android, inspired by [Clementine].

## Motivation

[Spotify] is a fantastic music service.  However, there are things I want to
listen to that it'll never have - primarily obscure or foreign artists.

When using my desktop computer, I can create playlists that seamlessly
integrate local files with those from Spotify, using Clementine.  Satsuma is an
attempt to bring this power to the mobile platform.
